    id: 'tricephalos',
    name: 'Tricephalos: Gladius Beast of the Knight',
    weakness: 'Holy (applies debuff)',
    strategy: `Holy applies a debuff. Takes many hits to apply to the fused version, takes only a couple to apply to a singular beast.
Debuff Effect: Unknown at this time, needs confirmation.
I’m inclined to believe it’s a damage and defense reduction (like an inverted Golden Vow) due to wildly inconsistent damage taken during the fight. Sometimes losing ~75% of health to an attack, other times only ~40%.`

  {
    id: 'gaping-jaw',
    name: 'Gaping Jaw: Adel Baron of the Knight',
    weakness: 'Poison',
    strategy: `Poison will cause Adel to stop whatever it’s doing to activate a throwing-up animation. If you can get around it during this time, you have a generous window for damage.
It might cancel command grabs sometimes, depending on how early poison is inflicted.`
  },
  {
    id: 'sentient-pest',
    name: 'Sentient Pest: Gnoster Wisdom of the Night',
    weakness: 'Fire (burning effect)',
    strategy: `Fire applies a burning effect if the moth is hit enough times, causing damage over time.
Recommended for ranged Nightfarers like Ironeye, Recluse, or Revenant. Melees should focus on the grounded monster; any element is fine.`
  },
  {
    id: 'augur',
    name: 'Augur: Maris Fathom of the Night',
    weakness: 'Lightning (stuns)',
    strategy: `Lightning appears to stun Maris out of its AoE sleep attack.
It might always stun, but it’s difficult to consistently hit during the fight. Needs confirmation.`
  },
  {
    id: 'equilibrious-beast',
    name: 'Equilibrious Beast: Libra Creature of the Night',
    weakness: 'Madness',
    strategy: `Madness causes a burst of damage and sends Libra into a rage that disables spellcasting and knocks him out of his buffed form.
Madness is hard to come by; Raider’s fully-powered Retaliate and Totem Stela can knock Libra out of meditation, making the fight easier.`
  },
  {
    id: 'darkdrift-knight',
    name: 'Darkdrift Knight: Fulghor Champion of Nightglow',
    weakness: 'Lightning (debuff)',
    strategy: `Lightning applies a debuff preventing Fulghor from accessing his buffed moveset.
Applying it consistently before or while he’s setting up his buff is key.`
  },
  {
    id: 'fissure-in-the-fog',
    name: 'Fissure in the Fog: Caligo Miasma of the Night',
    weakness: 'Fire (debuff)',
    strategy: `Fire applies a debuff that seems to weaken its frostbite effects significantly.`
