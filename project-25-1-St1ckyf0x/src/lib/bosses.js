    id: 'margit',
    name: 'Margit, the Fell Omen',
    weakness: 'Strike damage, Fire',
    strategy: `Use Spirit Ashes or summon allies to distract him. Margit is susceptible to fire and can be staggered with heavy weapons. Try to bait his combos and punish the long recovery on some of his larger swings.`
  },
  {
    id: 'godrick',
    name: 'Godrick the Grafted',
    weakness: 'Bleed, Fire',
    strategy: `Godrick is vulnerable to bleed damage and fire. Watch out for his wind-based attacks and phase two flamethrower arm. Stay behind him and punish after he slams or roars.`
  },
  {
    id: 'radahn',
    name: 'Starscourge Radahn',
    weakness: 'Rot, Magic',
    strategy: `Summon all available NPCs at the start of the festival. Use ranged attacks or hit-and-run tactics on horseback. Scarlet Rot damage-over-time builds are highly effective during both phases.`

  {
    id: 'rykard',
    name: 'Rykard, Lord of Blasphemy',
    weakness: 'Serpent-Hunter weapon',

    id: 'malenia',
    name: 'Malenia, Blade of Miquella',
    weakness: 'Frost, Bleed (to a degree)',
    strategy: `Malenia heals on every hit she lands. Avoid trading blows. Frostbite and bleed are effective, and strong Spirit Ashes can help. Dodge her Waterfowl Dance or get far away.`

    id: 'mohg',
    name: 'Mohg, Lord of Blood',
    weakness: 'Fire, Hemorrhage resistance',
    strategy: `Bring a Purifying Crystal Tear in your Flask to counter his phase transition attack. Fire damage works well. Keep pressure on him to prevent casting and avoid the blood flame AoEs.`

    id: 'elden-beast',
    name: 'Elden Beast',
    weakness: 'Holy resistant, use Magic or Strike',
    strategy: `Avoid holy damage as Elden Beast resists it. Use Magic and Strike-type weapons. Stay mobile, especially when it swims away and casts AoEs. Use lock-on sparingly due to size and movement.`
